# Skip the small talk

I enjoy deep conversations. When I learnt about [Kalina Silverman's Big Talk Project](https://www.makebigtalk.com/) I was really excited, but I didn't like the fact that I had to go through a pay wall to buy a deck of cards that I could use. I wasn't impressed by the design of the deck either, so I made my own. I crowdsourced questions from the [Jagriti Yatra Community](http://www.jagritiyatra.com/about), picked the really good ones and created a beautiful deck that is free for everyone.

[Skip the small talk](./Skip%20the%20small%20talk.pdf) is the PDF that contains all the questions set in A4 sized pages.

Page 12 is empty so that you can write your own questions.

Page 13 contains something that you can print on the backside of the cards.

Feel free to print them out and use them to make big talk.


##Codepen.io
After a while I realized that you don't need to print out a deck of cards and carry them around. You just need something simple that can throw random questions at you. And so I built a [codepen](https://codepen.io/tejasanilshah/full/gOpaLjj) that shows random questions to use.
It's a work in progress.
