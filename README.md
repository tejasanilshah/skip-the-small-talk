# Skip the small talk
Skip the small talk and ask these questions instead.

The PDF contains all the questions set in an A4 size page.
Page 12 is empty so that you can write your own questions.
Page 13 contains something that you can print on the backside of the cards.

Feel free to print them out and use them to make big talk.

#### TO-DO
Make a simple codepen that picks a question at random!
