        <p>Most of us long to have deep and meaningful conversations, but the social conventions of the current time don't really facilitate these kind of interactions. The focus generally moves towards small talk, or things that simply fill the awkward silences when interacting with people. But by acknowledging the need for "big" talk, and having a way to get to the good questions allows us to skip the small talk.</p>
A couple of pointers on how to use these questions:
        <ol>
          <li>Use these questions as starting points</li>
          <li>Remember, one half of conversation is listening</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.makebigtalk.com/">The Big Talk Project by Kalina Silverman</a>.</p>
<p>Although I loved the idea, I was disappointed by the design of the deck of cards that were being sold by the company. So I designed my own <a href="https://github.com/tejasanilshah/skip-the-small-talk/blob/master/Skip%20the%20small%20talk.pdf">deck</a> (~10 MB), and built this pen as an offshoot.</p>
